			<p>When accessing our services, we may store information on your device. This information is referred to as cookies, which are small text files that are stored on your device when you visit online pages that record your preferences. We also use Local Shared Objects or ‘flash cookies’. ‘Flash cookies’ are similar to browser cookies. They allow us to remember things about your visits across our sites.</p>
			<p>Neither cookies nor flash cookies can be used to access or use other information on your computer. We only use these methods to track your use of our services. Cookies help us monitor traffic to the site, improve our services and make it easier and/or more relevant for your use. We use flash cookies and third party cookies to help us show you more relevant and desirable advertisements.</p>
			<h4>Strictly necessary cookies</h4>
			<p>Strictly necessary cookies are essential to allow a user move around a website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website or making financial transactions. Without these cookies, we would not be able to make our websites work efficiently.</p>
			<h4>During the registration process</h4>
			<p>These cookies will hold information collected during your registration and will allow us to recognize you as a customer and provide you with the services you require. We may also use this data to better understand your interests while online and to enhance your visits to our platforms.</p>

			<p>For visitors to our website, we use cookies to collect information. Our servers use three different types of cookies:</p>

This cookie automatically expires when you close your browser.</p>
			<p>A ‘persistent’ cookie: This type of cookie will remain on your computer for a period of time set for each cookie. Flash cookies are also persistent.</p>

			<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether.</p>
			<h4>Flash cookies</h4>

To disallow flash cookies from all third party content go to the ‘Global Storage Settings’ panel of the Settings Manager and de-select the check box labelled ‘Allow third party flash content to store information on your computer’ and close the Settings Manager.
