            <h1>Exchange Rules and Regulations</h1>

            <h2>Part A - Introduction</h2>

            <h3>1. Use and interpretation</h3>

            <p>
              The Exchange Rules and Regulations ("Exchange Rules") are part of
              terms and conditions.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Exchange Rules apply to all bets placed on Exchange markets.
              The Exchange Rules also apply to Exchange ’Multiples’ product (see
              the Multiples section below for further details). The Exchange
              Rules consist of the following:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>This INTRODUCTION section (Part A);</li>

              <li>The GENERAL RULES (set out in Part B below);</li>

              <li>
                The SPECIFIC SPORTS RULES (set out in Part C below – these apply
                to certain sports and to financial markets); and
              </li>

              <li>
                The MARKET INFORMATION (located on every market either under the
                tab entitled "Rules" or under the ‘Rules’).
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The General Rules apply to all bets unless stated otherwise in the
              Market Information or the Specific Sports Rules. If there is any
              inconsistency between the Specific Sports Rules and the General
              Rules, the Specific Sports Rules shall prevail. If there is any
              inconsistency between the Market Information and either the
              General Rules or the Specific Sports Rules, the Market Information
              shall prevail, except where the General Rules or Specific Sports
              Rules use the phrase 'regardless of what it says in the Market
              Information' or similar wording.
            </p>

            <p>
              For any category or market not referred to in the Specific Sports
              Rules (e.g. ’Special Bets’ or beach volleyball), the General Rules
              and Market Information will apply.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Market information</h3>

            <p>
              The Market Information is provided for information purposes as an
              at-a-glance guide on how to manage the market. The Market
              Information may also contain rules on market settlement, however
              it must always be read in conjunction with the General Rules and
              the relevant Specific Sports Rules and a link to this Rules and
              Regulations page will usually be provided in the Market
              Information for each market.
            </p>

            <p>
              Whilst the Market Information may give a guide to how markets will
              be managed, regardless of what it says in the Market Information,
              it reserves the right to suspend any market at any time at its
              sole discretion, including in order to carry out necessary
              administration and/or to take any necessary action to protect the
              customers.
            </p>

            <p>
              It shall not amend the Market Information after a market has been
              loaded except to correct obvious errors and/or to add wording to
              clarify the Market Information where appropriate.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Customer responsibility</h3>

            <p>
              The customers should make themselves aware of all the Exchange
              Rules affecting any market on which they wish to place a bet.
              Customers should not simply rely on the Market Information as the
              Market Information is unlikely to contain all of the applicable
              rules relating to a market.
            </p>

            <p>
              By their nature ‘Special Bets’ markets are unpredictable so should
              be treated with particular caution. Customers are responsible for
              managing their own positions at all times in such markets.
              Customers should pay particular attention to the Market
              Information on ‘Special Bets’ markets to ensure they understand
              the basis on which the market will be administered and settled.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Customer betting disputes & IBAS</h3>

            <p>
              Any customer who has any concerns or questions regarding the
              Exchange Rules or regarding the settlement of any market should
              contact.
            </p>

            <p>
              If a customer is not satisfied with how a bet or a market has been
              settled then the customer should provide details of their
              grievance.
            </p>

            <h2>Part B - General rules</h2>

            <h3>1. Managing markets In-Play</h3>

            <h4>a) General</h4>

            <ul>
              <li>
                For everything other than horseracing and greyhound racing, if a
                market is not scheduled to be turned in-play but fails to
                suspend the market at the relevant time, then:

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    if the event has a scheduled 'off' time, all bets matched
                    after that scheduled off time will be void; and
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    if the event does not have a scheduled 'off' time, it will
                    use its reasonable endeavours to ascertain the time of the
                    actual 'off' and all bets after the time of the 'off'
                    determined will be void.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>
                For horseracing and greyhound racing, if a market is not
                scheduled to be turned in-play but fails to suspend the market
                at the relevant time, then all bets matched after the official
                'off' time will be void.
              </li>

              <li>
                It aims to use its reasonable endeavours to suspend in-play
                markets at the start of and at the end of the event. However,
                regardless of what it says in the Market Information, it does
                not guarantee that such markets will be suspended at the
                relevant time.
              </li>

              <li>
                It will not part-suspend outcomes/selections in an Exchange
                market that has been turned in-play.
              </li>

              <li>
                Customers are responsible for managing their in-play bets at all
                times.
              </li>

              <li>
                For the purposes of in-play betting, customers should be aware
                that transmissions described as "live" by some broadcasters may
                be delayed or pre-recorded. The extent of any delay may vary
                depending on the set-up through which they are receiving
                pictures or data.
              </li>
            </ul>

                in-play at the time of the 'off'. The time of the 'off' for such
                markets should be set out in the Market Information. However,
                regardless of what it says in the Market Information, it does
                not guarantee that such markets will be suspended and turned

                cancelled at any time during the event, all bets matched after
                the scheduled time of the 'off' will be void (in the case of
                horseracing and greyhound racing, bets will be void from the

                are not cancelled at that time), but the market is intentionally
                turned in-play at a later time during the event, all bets

                In relation to soccer markets that are scheduled to be turned
                in-play, aims to use its reasonable endeavours to turn such
                markets in-play at kick-off and to suspend such markets on the
                occurrence of a Material Event (see definition of "Material
                Event" below).
              </li>

              <li>
                The relevant scheduled kick-off time should be set out in the
                Market Information. However, regardless of what it says in the
                Market Information, it does not guarantee that such markets will
                be suspended and turned in-play at kick-off.
              </li>

              <li>
                If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but not suspend
                the market at kick-off and the market is not turned in-play at
                any time during the match, all bets matched after the scheduled
                time of the kick-off will be void.

                the market at kick-off (so unmatched bets are not cancelled at
                that time), but the market is turned in-play at a later time
                during the match, all bets matched after the scheduled time of
                the kick-off and before the first "Material Event" will stand.
                However, if there has been one or more "Material Events", any
                bets matched between the first "Material Event" and the market
                being turned in-play will be void.

                If it does not suspend a market on time for the occurrence of a
                Material Event, it reserves the right to void bets unfairly
                matched after the Material Event has occurred. Voiding of these
                bets may take place during the event or retrospectively once a
                game is completed.

            <ul>

                For the purpose of these Exchange Rules, a "Material Event"
                shall mean a goal being scored, a penalty being awarded or a
                player being sent off.

              <li>
                Notwithstanding the other in-play rules described above, in
                relation specifically to any Australian market that is scheduled
                to be turned in-play, if it fails to suspend the market at the
                'off' then all bets matched after the scheduled time of the
                'off' and before the market is turned in-play will be void (in
                the case of horseracing and greyhound racing, bets will be void
                from the official rather than the scheduled ‘off’ time). If the
                event does not have a scheduled 'off' time, it will use its
                reasonable endeavours to ascertain the time of the actual 'off'
                and all bets after the time of the 'off' as determined will be
                void.

            <h3>2. Results and market settlement</h3>

            <h4>a) General</h4>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Markets will be settled as set out in the Market Information
                and/or the Specific Sports Rules.
              </li>

              <li>
                Where the Market Information or Specific Sports Rules do not
                specify how and on what basis a market will be settled, markets
                will be settled on the official result of the relevant governing
                body regardless of any subsequent disqualification or amendment
                to the result (except if an amendment is announced within 24
                hours of the initial settlement of the relevant market in order
                to correct an error in reporting the result).
              </li>

              <li>
                If no official result of a relevant governing body is available,
                the result will be determined by using information from
                independent sources. In such cases, if any new information comes
                into the public domain within 48 hours of settlement, then it
                shall (acting reasonably) determine either: (i) whether the
                market should be reinstated or resettled in light of this new
                information; or (ii) whether or not to wait for further
                information before deciding whether to reinstate or resettle the
                market. Except it has announced that it is waiting for further
                information, any information that comes into the public domain
                more than 48 hours after a market has been settled shall not be
                considered (regardless of whether or not such information may
                have led to a different result).
              </li>

              <li>
                In the event of any uncertainty about any result or potential
                result, it reserves the right to suspend settlement of any
                market for an unlimited period until the uncertainty can be
                resolved to the reasonable satisfaction. It reserves the right
                to void any market if the uncertainty regarding settlement
                cannot be resolved to reasonable satisfaction.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>b) Resettlements</h4>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Markets are generally settled shortly after the end of the event
                in question. It may settle (or part-settle) some markets before
                the official result is declared (or may increase a customer's
                'available to bet' balance by the minimum potential winnings of
                that customer on a given market) purely as a customer service
                benefit. However, it reserves the right to amend the settlement
                of the market if: (i) the official result is different to the
                result on which initially settled the market (for example, a
                horseracing result being changed by the relevant governing body
                shortly after a race, but before the result is official); or
                (ii) if the whole market is eventually voided (e.g. for an
                abandoned event).
              </li>

              <li>
                It reserves the right to reverse the settlement of a market if a
                market is settled in error (for example, a human or technical
                error).
              </li>

              <li>
                If resettles a market, this may lead to amendments being made to
                a customer's balance to reflect changes in market settlement.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>c) Non-runners, withdrawals and disqualifications</h4>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Subject always right to void bets under its terms and conditions
                or for any exception under the Exchange Rules, if a market
                contains a statement that says, "All bets stand, run or not" (or
                something similar) in the Market Information, then all bets on a
                team or competitor will stand regardless of whether or not the
                team or competitor starts the event or takes any part in the
                event.
              </li>

              <li>
                Where the Market Information does not stipulate that all bets
                will stand regardless of participation, customers should refer
                to the relevant Specific Sports Rules.
              </li>

              <li>
                If a team or competitor is disqualified, withdraws or forfeits
                after starting an event they will be deemed a loser providing at
                least one other team or competitor completes the event. If no
                team or competitor completes an event (having started) then all
                bets will be void except for bets on any markets which have been
                unconditionally determined.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>d) Winner with [named selection]' markets</h4>

            <ul>
              <li>
                It may from time to time offer markets that are dependent on the
                participation of a particular competitor. If the competitor
                named either in a 'Winner with …' market title or in the Market
                Information does not participate in the tournament or event then
                all bets on the market will be void. For example, if there was a
                "Winner with Federer" tennis market, all bets on the market
                would be void if Federer did not participate in the tournament.
                However, if any other competitor did not participate, then bets
                would stand.
              </li>

              <li>
                A team or competitor will be deemed to have participated if they
                have taken part to the extent necessary to record an official
                result or classification (including any disqualification but
                excluding any "did not start" or equivalent classification).
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Abandonments, Cancellations, Postponements</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the
                Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market Information. However,
                where a market has no rules in the Specific Sports Rules or the
                Market Information in relation to an abandonment, cancellation
                and/or postponement the following shall apply.
              </li>

              <li>
                In relation to any match, fixture, game, individual event, race
                or similar: If the event is not completed within three days
                after the scheduled completion date, then all bets on markets
                for this event will be void, except for bets on any markets that
                have been unconditionally determined.
              </li>

              <li>
                In relation to any tournament, competition or similar: If the
                event is not completed within three days after the scheduled
                completion date, then any markets relating to the event will be
                settled in accordance with the official ruling of the relevant
                governing body, providing such a decision is given within 90
                days after the scheduled completion date. If no official ruling
                is announced in this 90-day period, then bets on any market
                relating to this event will be void, except for bets on any
                markets which have been unconditionally determined. If a market
                is to be voided but has been part-settled as a courtesy to
                customers, then such part-settled bets will be reversed and all
                bets on the market will be void.
              </li>

              <li>
                It will decide (acting reasonably) whether a market relates to a
                match (or similar) or a tournament (or similar). However, by way
                of example, the following shall apply: (i) Europa League
                outright = tournament; (ii) Champions’ League Group outright =
                tournament; (iii) Top Premiership goal scorer = tournament; (iv)
                72-hole Golf Match bet = match; (v) Ryder Cup outright =
                tournament; (vi) Golf tournament outright = tournament; (vii)
                Tennis Tournament outright = tournament;(viii) 5-day Cricket
                Test Match = match; (ix) Ashes Series outright winner =
                tournament; (x) Motor Race (e.g. Grand Prix) = match.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Change of venue</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the
                Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market Information. However, if
                change of venue is not dealt with in the Specific Sports Rules
                and/or the Market Information then the following shall apply:
              </li>

              <li>
                For any team sport: if the scheduled venue is changed after the
                market is loaded, all bets will be void only if the new venue is
                a home ground of the original away team
              </li>

              <li>
                For all categories or markets other than team sports: if the
                scheduled venue is changed after the market is loaded, all bets
                will stand.
              </li>

              <li>
                If there is a change in the type of scheduled surface (e.g. a
                hockey match switching from grass to Astor-turf) after the
                market has been loaded, all bets will stand.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Periods of time</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the
                Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market Information. However, if
                not dealt with in the Specific Sports Rules or the Market
                Information then the following shall apply.
              </li>

              <li>
                If the scheduled duration of an event is changed after the
                market has been loaded but before the start of the event, then
                all bets will be void.
              </li>

              <li>
                Some markets refer to the length of time until an occurrence in
                the event (e.g. time of first goal). If an event happens in
                stoppage or injury time after any regular time period then it
                will be deemed to have occurred at the end of the regular time
                period. For example, if a goal is scored in first half
                stoppage-time in a soccer match it will be deemed to have
                occurred on 45 minutes.
              </li>

              <li>
                All bets apply to the relevant full 'regular time' period
                including stoppage time. Any extra-time and/or penalty shoot-out
                is not included.
              </li>

              <li>
                References within these Rules and Regulations to a particular
                number of 'days' shall mean the end of the day local time after
                the expiry of the specified number of days. For example, if a
                rugby match is scheduled for the 1st of December, then the rule
                that allows the match to be completed within three days after
                the scheduled completion date (see Paragraph 3 above) would mean
                that the deadline for completion of that match would be 23.59:59
                on the 4th of December.
              </li>
            </ul>

                Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the
                Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market Information. For
                example, for match bets on Golf markets the rules are set out in
                the Specific Sports Rules. However, if not dealt with in the
                Specific Sports Rules or the Market Information then the
                following shall apply.
              </li>

              <li>
                'Match Bets' for one-off events are determined by the competitor
                or team with the best score, time or finishing position in the
                event. If none of the competitors or teams involved in the match
                bet complete the event or register a score, time or finishing
                position then bets are void unless specified otherwise in the
                Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market Information. Any
                competitor or team not completing an event or registering a
                score, time or finishing position having taken part in the match
                bet event will be settled as a loser providing at least one
                other team or competitor completes that event or registers a
                score, time or finishing position.
              </li>

              <li>
                'Match Bets' for progress in a competition or event with
                multiple heats or rounds are determined by the competitor or
                team which qualifies to the furthest round (whether it takes
                part in the further round or not) or with the best score, time
                or finishing position in the final or same heat of that
                competition or event. If the relevant competitors or teams fail
                to qualify in the same round of the competition but in different
                heats then dead-heat rules will apply, irrespective of the
                finishing positions in their respective heats. Markets will be
                part-settled after the end of each round and any subsequent
                disqualifications, penalties or amendments to results or
                qualifications will not have any effect on the market. Where one
                or more of the competitors or teams are disqualified, for the
                purposes of settlement, the disqualified competitor or team will
                be deemed to have progressed further in the competition or event
                than all those eliminated from the competition or event prior to
                the disqualification, and will be deemed to have finished last
                (or joint last if there is more than one disqualification) of
                those still competing in the competition or event.
                Disqualification will be considered to have taken place at the
                time of the competitor's or team's removal from the competition
                or event by the relevant governing body, rather than at the time
                of the event which caused disqualification.
              </li>

              <li>
                If one of the competitors or teams does not take any part in the
                event, then all relevant match bets will be void.
              </li>

              <li>
                If an event or tournament is abandoned or reduced in duration
                such that any competitor or team fails to complete the match
                bet, event or tournament for any reason other than withdrawal or
                disqualification then all bets will be void except for those on
                markets which have been unconditionally determined.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>7. "To qualify" markets</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the
                Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market Information. However, if
                not dealt with in the Specific Sports Rules or the Market
                Information then the following shall apply.
              </li>

              <li>
                Any 'to qualify' market (e.g. "to reach the final" markets) will
                be determined by the competitor or team that qualifies under the
                terms set out in Market Information, whether or not they take
                part in the next round or event for which they have qualified.
                Markets will be settled after the qualifying stage and any
                subsequent disqualification or amendment to the result will not
                count.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>8. Dead heats</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Unless stated otherwise in the Specific Sports Rules and/or the
                Market Information the Dead Heat Rule applies to bets on a
                market where there are more winners than expected (as set out in
                the Market Information).
              </li>

              <li>
                For each bet matched on a relevant winning selection, the stake
                money is first reduced in proportion by multiplying it by the
                sum of the number of winners expected (as set out in the Market
                Information), divided by the number of actual winners (i.e.
                stake multiplied by (number of winners expected/number of actual
                winners)). The winnings are then paid to the successful backers
                on this 'reduced stake' (reduced stake multiplied by traded
                price) and the remaining stake money is paid to the appropriate
                layers.
              </li>

              <li>
                For example, assume there is a dead heat for first place between
                three horses. 'Client A' has backed one of the winners for a
                stake of 300 at the traded price of 4.0 and 'Client B' has taken
                the other side of this bet. When the event is settled, the stake
                (300) is multiplied by 1/3 (i.e. the number of expected winners
                (1) divided by the number of actual winners (3)) to calculate
                the reduced stake (100) and the remainder given to the layer
                (200). The backer then receives the traded price matched (4.0)
                multiplied by the reduced stake (4 x 100 = 400). In this
                example, Client A's net winnings are 100 (400 payout minus the
                original 300 stake), and Client B's net losses are 100.
                Alternatively, this can be viewed as the full amount paid to the
                traded price divided by the number of dead-heaters. In the above
                example, this would be 300 at the traded price of 4.0 (1200)
                divided by 3; making 400 payouts and 100 net winnings.
              </li>

              <li>
                By way of another example, assume there is an outright winner in
                a golf tournament but 7 players tie for 2nd place. In the "top 5
                finish" market, after settling on the outright winner in the top
                5 market there would be 4 others designated winner’s places
                available. 'Client A' has backed one of the winners for 300 at
                the traded price of 4.0 and 'Client B' has taken the other side
                of this bet. When the event is settled, the stake (300) is
                multiplied by 4/7 (i.e. the number of expected winners (4)
                divided by the number of actual winners (7)) to calculate the
                reduced stake (171.43) and the remainder given to the layer
                (128.57). The backer then receives the traded price matched
                (4.0) multiplied by the reduced stake (4 x 171.43 = 685.72). In
                this example, Client A's net winnings are 385.72 (685.72 payout
                minus the original 300 stake), and Client B's net losses are
                385.72.
              </li>

              <li>
                In relation to customers whose betting counterparty, for the
                purposes of this section of the Exchange Rules dealing with dead
                heats, the terms 'Client A', 'Client B' and 'appropriate layers'
                should, where relevant, be read
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>9. Exchange Multiples</h3>

            <p>The Exchange Rules only apply to Exchange Multiples.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Customers placing a multiple bet will be betting with each other
                will act as the counterparty to the bet.
              </li>

              <li>
                A multiple bet consists of a number of legs. A leg is defined as
                one or more chosen selections in any individual event market.
              </li>

              <li>
                It reserves the right in its sole discretion not to accept
                certain multiple bets or to scale back stakes in certain
                circumstances.
              </li>

              <li>
                All multiple bets placed are subject to the Exchange Rules that
                apply to each individual sport that relates to any leg of any
                multiple bet.
              </li>

              <li>
                The maximum payout limit for Exchange Multiples is £1,000,000.
              </li>

              <li>
                Customers can place an Exchange Multiple bet using back, or
                where available lay or a mixture of back and lay selections.
                However, customers cannot have a combination of back and lay
                selections in any one leg.
              </li>

              <li>
                If customers choose more than one selection in one leg the odds
                for this leg will be "dutched" which means they will be combined
                to reflect the chances of any of the selections within the leg
                winning (if backed) or all of the selections losing (if laid).
                If customers wish to place a cross-multiple bet (i.e. more than
                one selection in any event market but not using "dutched"
                prices) they will need to enter each Exchange Multiple bet
                separately.
              </li>

              <li>
                Other than Exchange Multiples bets struck at Starting Price
                ("BSP"), the odds available via the Exchange Multiples product
                will be broadly based on the relevant singles markets on the
                Exchange and any such winning multiple bet will be subject to
                commission as set out in the Charges' section of the website.
              </li>

              <li>
                Any winnings from Exchange Multiples bets struck at BSP will not
                be subject to commission, but the odds returned on each leg in
                such a multiple will be subject to a 5% deduction from the BSP.
              </li>

              <li>
                A BSP each way Exchange Multiple bet is a bet for selections in
                the multiple to win and a bet on the same selections to place.
                For example, a £2 each way double represents a £2 bet on both
                selections to win and a £2 bet on both selections to be placed,
                with a total stake for the bet of £4. The number of places for
                each event in each way multiples bet are shown on the multiples
                win Market Information and do not change. Should the number of
                runners be equal to or less than the number of places available,
                the relevant place leg of any multiples bet will be void
              </li>

              <li>
                The minimum total stake for any Exchange Multiple bet is £2. For
                example, a 20p "Yankee" (11 bet combinations) representing a
                total stake of £2.20 is permitted. However, a 1p "Heinz" (57 bet
                combinations) representing a total stake of £0.57 or a £1 double
                (1 bet combination) representing a total stake of £1 will not be
                permitted. For customers betting in currencies other than
                English Sterling, the minimum total stake which applies to an
                Exchange Multiple bet will not necessarily be the equivalent of
                £2, though it will be calculated as described in the example
                above.
              </li>

              <li>
                If, in its sole discretion, will determine the markets that are
                available for Exchange Multiples. Events available for Exchange
                Multiples will be those listed within any individual Exchange
                Multiple group (e.g. UK football fixtures for any given day).
                Not all markets will be available via the Exchange Multiples
                product.
              </li>

              <li>
                With the exception of the rule directly below, if any selection
                in any leg is a non-runner or otherwise void under the Exchange
                Rules (e.g. an abandoned match) then all bets on that individual
                leg will be void and the Exchange Multiple bet shall be adjusted
                accordingly. For example, a treble including one void leg will
                become a double. This means that if customers have more than one
                selection in any leg (i.e. in cases of 'ditching') and one of
                those selections is a non-runner, the whole leg will be void. In
                the event that voided legs mean that an individual bet within a
                multiple becomes a single bet, then this single bet will stand.
              </li>

              <li>
                Notwithstanding the rule directly above, for Exchange Multiples
                bets struck at BSP, if customers have more than one selection in
                any leg and one of those selections is a non-runner the leg will
                stand. For example, if customers back both Desert Orchid and Red
                Rum in an individual horse race and Red Rum is a non-runner, the
                leg will become a back of just Desert Orchid.
              </li>

              <li>
                It reserves the right not to accept certain combinations of
                Exchange Multiples, such as those including related
                contingencies (i.e. where the outcome of one event is likely to
                affect the odds on the outcome of another event). This may
                happen automatically at the bet placement stage. Alternatively,
                if such bet is taken in error, it may void the individual bet
                combinations which include two or more of the related
                contingency selections.
              </li>

                It may offer special markets on related events from time to
                time, including within its normal markets (i.e. outside of the
                Exchange Multiples product), for example a market on Chelsea to
                win the English domestic double (i.e. Premiership and FA Cup).
              </li>

              <li>
                When placing any Exchange Multiple bet, the prices shown only
                give an indicative guide as to the price available for each leg
                and the overall multiple. Other than Exchange Multiples bets
                struck at BSP, the price of each leg and the overall multiple
                price that customers get will be fixed when the multiple bet is
                actually placed and customers will then be able to see these
                prices. For more details on this customer should refer to the
                'help' files.
              </li>

              <li>
                Horseracing Exchange Multiples are based on ‘day of the race’
                markets (and not ante-post markets). Horseracing ante-post rules
                do not therefore apply in relation to horseracing Exchange
                Multiples.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>10. Rules for Starting Price</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Starting Price ('SP') is available on the Exchange. Exchange SP
                bets (‘SP bets’) are therefore a type of Exchange bet. The SP is
                calculated as, by balancing all SP bets and other Exchange bets
                when the market is suspended at the 'off' of the relevant event.
                The details of this calculation are provided directly below.
              </li>

              <li>
                Please note that for all customers, an SP bet cannot be
                cancelled once it has been placed.
              </li>

              <li>
                A bet at SP is a fixed odd bet, with the odds on each selection
                being calculated and bets matched when the event starts. The
                odds are calculated by matching SP backers and other Exchange
                backers against SP layers and other Exchange layers. The
                inclusion of other Exchange bets in the SP reconciliation is
                necessary to ensure that: SP backers get the benefit of
                unmatched Exchange offers to lay if those offers could increase
                the SP; and SP layers get the benefit of unmatched Exchange
                offers to back if those offers could reduce the SP. Including
                unmatched other Exchange in the SP reconciliation also ensures
                that the bets of other Exchange backers and layers, which would
                otherwise lapse, are matched where possible.
              </li>

              <li>
                The minimum liability for a bet placed at SP is £10 for a lay
                bet and £2 for a back bet (or the currency equivalent in each
                case).
              </li>

              <li>
                Example 1: on selection A there is £1,000 of backers' stakes and
                £6,000 of layers' liabilities at SP and there are £500 of
                unmatched other Exchange back bets available to lay at an
                average of 5.0. If we ignored the Exchange market in this case
                the SP would be 7.0. However, this would leave other Exchange
                back bets, that could also have been matched at their requested
                price against SP layers, unmatched. Therefore, the SP will be
                5.0 and all SP backers and SP layers will be matched at that
                price. The £500 of Exchange backers' stakes will also be matched
                at their requested price of 5.0 against the SP layers.
              </li>

              <li>
                Example 2: on selection B there are £831 of backers' stakes and
                £4,428 of layers' liabilities at SP and the following unmatched
                other Exchange lay bets, available to back: £20 at 6.8, £31.13
                at 6.6 and £100 at 6.4. In this case the SP will be 6.68. This
                is calculated by including the £20 available to back at 6.8 and
                the £31.13 available to back at 6.6 and balancing those amounts
                against the SP backers' stakes and SP layers' liabilities. The
                £100 available to back on the Exchange at 6.4 remains unmatched
                as to include any of this amount would lead to an imbalance
                between SP backers and SP layers.
              </li>

              <li>
                The SP is calculated to six decimal places for each selection,
                though it may be displayed in the relevant market view (or in
                any form/results data) to two decimal places, rounded up or down
                as applicable. After reconciliation, the full SP on each
                selection is available by clicking on the relevant individual
                runner graph.
              </li>

              <li>
                If for whatever reason the site is unavailable when an event
                starts or the SP cannot otherwise be reconciled at the 'off’, it
                will determine the SP using all available information. For the
                avoidance of doubt this information will not be limited to
                betting activity on the relevant market(s). Also in these
                circumstances, a licensed betting operator within the group may
                act as risk counterparty to SP bets if necessary to ensure a
                fair SP. The personnel involved in determining the SP in such
                circumstances will have no undeclared personal or other interest
                in the SP in question.
              </li>

              <li>
                If the SP reconciliation process is undertaken prematurely (for
                example if a horserace is turned in-play in error), then it will
                endeavor to reverse the reconciliation so that the SP is
                determined when the event starts. There may however be
                circumstances in which this is not possible, in which case the
                SP will be based on the initial reconciliation.
              </li>

              <li>
                In cases where an SP reconciliation is reversed: SP bets
                (including SP limit bets), 'At In-play: Take SP' bets and 'At
                In-play: Keep' bets will all revert to their status before the
                reconciliation; and 'At In-play: Cancel' bets will either remain
                cancelled if not matched as part of the reconciliation process,
                or if matched as part of the reconciliation process, will revert
                to their unmatched status before the reconciliation.
              </li>

              <li>
                If the SP reconciliation process is undertaken later than
                scheduled (i.e. after the event has started) and determines that
                a material event has occurred (this will generally mean that the
                event is not turned in-play), the SP will be determined based
                solely on SP bets (and ‘At In-play: Take SP’ bets which are
                unmatched when suspends the relevant market), placed before the
                'off'. This means that ‘At In-play: Take SP’ bets matched after
                the off, will be made void and not included in the
                reconciliation process. In addition, SP bets placed after the
                'off' will be voided. However, if the SP reconciliation process
                is undertaken later than scheduled but determines that no
                material event has occurred, all bets will stand.
              </li>

              <li>
                If a SP 'each way' option is offered this will be processed as
                two separate bets: a win bet at SP and a 'to be placed' bet at
                SP.
              </li>

              <li>
                If for any reason unmatched bets are cancelled prior to a market
                going in-play, then any unmatched bets that have been selected
                to 'At In-play: Take SP' will be converted to SP bets. Once
                those bets are converted, they cannot be cancelled.
              </li>

            <h4>➢ Party against whom you are betting at SP</h4>

            <ul>
              <li>
                When you place a bet at SP you are betting against other
                customers. However, during the reconciliation of the SP, it acts
                as counterparty in order to balance liabilities between SP bets
                and other Exchange bets
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>➢ Placing a SP bet</h4>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Selecting the 'SP' button in the market view gives customers two
                different ways to request an SP bet. These are as follows:
              </li>

              <li>
                The first way to request a bet at SP is by leaving the 'Set SP
                odds limit' box unticked at the top right of the bet manager.
                For a back bet you are required to enter the stake you wish to
                bet on the selection. For a lay bet, you are required to enter
                the liability you are prepared to risk against the selection –
                in other words the amount that you are prepared to lose, should
                the selection win (or be placed as applicable).
              </li>

              <li>
                The second way to request a bet at SP is to select the 'Set SP
                odds limit' option. Using this you can request a bet at SP
                conditional upon minimum SP odds in the case of a back bet, or
                maximum SP odds in the case of a lay bet. If SP is shorter than
                the minimum price requested by a backer or is longer than the
                maximum price requested by a layer, then the relevant bet will
                lapse when the event starts. If SP is longer than the minimum
                price requested by a backer or is shorter than the maximum price
                requested by a layer, the bet will be matched at the SP. Where
                an SP is equal to the price limit specified by customers, those
                bets will be included based on the time they were submitted, on
                a first come, first served basis as is the existing convention
                for other Exchange bets. This means that such bets may be
                unmatched or partially matched.
              </li>

              <li>
                Please note that if a non-runner cannot be removed from the
                relevant market until after the completion of the event, the
                application to all bets matched at or before the "off"
                (including SP bets) of any reduction factor, may mean that the
                matched price for an SP back bet with an odds limit requested,
                is adjusted to a price below the lower limit requested. It may
                also mean that an SP lay bet request with maximum odds
                requested, may not be matched even though the odds on the
                selection, after any post-race adjustment for the late
                non-runner, is below the maximum odds requested.
              </li>

              <li>
                If an SP bet with an odds limit is requested, the
                minimum/maximum odds requested can be shortened in the case of a
                back bet or a lengthened in the case of a lay bet at any time
                before the event starts. However, as mentioned above, an SP bet
                request cannot actually be cancelled by a customer once it has
                been placed. Details of the impact of non-runners on the SP re
                provided below.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>➢ Exchange bets which are unmatched at the 'off'</h4>

            <ul>
              <li>
                A normal Exchange bet is placed by choosing the odds of your
                selection from the market view (as opposed to clicking on the
                'SP' of your selection). When such an Exchange bet is fully or
                partially unmatched it can be adjusted and cancelled in the
                normal course. Previously, unmatched bets were automatically
                cancelled when a market was suspended at the 'off' of the
                relevant event. You can now choose to either have your unmatched
                Exchange bet convert to an SP bet when the market suspends at
                the start of the event, or to have the bet 'persist' when the
                event goes in-play (see the 'keep' option below).
              </li>

              <li>
                In order to convert your unmatched Exchange bet to an SP bet
                when the market suspends you should select the 'At In-Play: Take
                SP' option in the bet manager. If there is a non-runner in a win
                market with a reduction factor of at least 2.5%, or a non-runner
                in a place market with a reduction factor of at least 4%, it is
                policy to cancel unmatched lay bets on all other runners in the
                market. In the case of any such non-runner, instead of being
                cancelled a lay bet for which the 'At In-Play: Take SP' option
                has been selected, will automatically convert to an SP bet.
                After this conversion, the bet cannot be cancelled. Otherwise,
                unlike an SP bet, you can choose to cancel an Exchange bet once
                it has been placed, even if you have chosen for the bet to
                persist or to convert to an SP bet at the start of the event.
              </li>

              <li>
                If you choose to convert an unmatched Exchange lay bet to an SP
                bet, the liability of your Exchange lay bet will be converted
                into a liability for the SP bet. Your liability for that SP bet
                will never be more than the liability for the Exchange bet you
                had specified. However, the amount you can win on the SP lay bet
                may differ from the amount you would have won had the Exchange
                bet been matched, depending on the final SP.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>➢ Adjustments to SP bets for non-runners</h4>

            <ul>
              <li>
                For SP back bets, will at no point amend either the stake or the
                odds requested by a customer, despite any non-runners or
                withdrawals. However, customers who have selected the SP limit
                option can reduce the minimum SP odds they are prepared to
                accept on a selection.
              </li>

              <li>
                For SP lay bets on win markets, it will reduce a customer's
                liability based on the reduction factor(s) of any non-runner(s)
                and the reduction factor of the runner on which the customer's
                bet has been placed. This is to ensure that the balance between
                the backers' stakes and the layers' liability reflects the
                revised market after the runner has been removed. For example,
                if a horse with a 50% reduction factor becomes a non-runner,
                then another horse in the same market priced at about 5 (i.e. a
                reduction factor of 20%) will change to a price of about 2.5.
                Therefore, the liability on a £200 lay bet on that runner will
                need to change to a liability of about £75 to ensure that a
                balancing back bet will have the same £50 stake. This is done by
                multiplying the liability by 37.5% (i.e. 100%-(50%/
                (100%-20%))).
              </li>

              <li>
                Where an SP lay bet in a win market has a maximum odds limit
                specified, this limit will be reduced by the reduction factor of
                any non-runner, if the non-runner has a reduction factor of at
                least 2.5%.
              </li>

              <li>
                For SP lay bets on place markets, it will still reduce a
                customer's liability based on the reduction factor(s) of any
                non-runner(s) but the calculation will be slightly different, in
                line with the application of place market reduction factors. The
                liability will be reduced by the reduction factor of the removed
                runner. Where the lay bet on a place market has a maximum odds
                limit specified, the potential winnings on the bet (i.e. the
                odds – 1) will be reduced by the reduction factor of the removed
                runner.
              </li>

              <li>
                Where an SP lay bet in a place market has a maximum odds limit
                specified this limit will be reduced by the reduction factor of
                any non-runner.
              </li>

              <li>
                SP lay bets will not be cancelled when there is a non-runner.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>
                ALL SP bets will stand so long as your trap selection is not
                vacant or after your bet placement a reserve runner is not
                subsequently entered to run from your trap selection.
              </li>

              <li>
                ALL unmatched ‘Convert to SP’ bets will be cancelled when a

            <h3>11. 'Keep' bets option</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>
                For markets that are scheduled to be turned in-play at the
                'off', a customer can request that an unmatched Exchange bet
                should not be cancelled when the market is turned in-play. This
                is done by selecting the 'At In-Play: Keep' option in the bet
                manager (and confirming that request) and means that the
                unmatched bet persists when other unmatched bets are cancelled
                at the start of the event.
              </li>

              <li>
                As described above, when a non-runner is removed from a
                horseracing market (apart for late withdrawals as described in
                the next bullet point below), it is policy to cancel unmatched
                offers to lay all other horses in the market if the non-runner
                has a reduction factor of 2.5% or greater for win markets, or
                4.0% or greater for place markets. In these circumstances offers
                to lay a horse with the 'At In-Play: Keep' option selected will
                not be cancelled. Instead the lay odds offered in place markets
                will be reduced in proportion with the reduction factors of any
                non-runner(s) and the same will apply in win markets providing
                the relevant non-runner has a reduction factor of at least 2.5%.
              </li>

              <li>
                When there is a late withdrawal, may not have time to remove the
                non-runner from the market before turning it in-play. In such
                cases if can determine that the late withdrawal is a material
                runner (i.e. a selection with a reduction factor of approx. 20%
                or greater in the win market), it reserves the right to cancel
                ALL lay 'keep' bets (in both the win and ‘to be placed’ markets)
                before turning the market in-play. If it does not cancel lay
                'keep' bets in the case of a late withdrawal (for example, it
                may not be possible to know which horse is withdrawn, at the
                time of the off), any such bets placed before the off and
                matched in-play will remain at the original selected price. This
                means that those lay 'keep' bets will not be subject to any
                reduction factor which as a result of the late withdrawal, will
                be applied after the completion of the race to bets matched at
                or before the 'off'.
              </li>

              <li>
                Otherwise, in exceptional cases reserves the right to cancel
                'keep' bets to protect customers but, unless stipulated in the
                market rules or the market information, the general principle is
                that at no point will a 'keep' bet be cancelled by unless it
                remains unmatched when the market is closed (for the final time)
                at the end of the event.
              </li>

              <li>
                For the avoidance of doubt this means that (for example) when a
                Material Event occurs in a soccer match and other unmatched bets
                are cancelled before the market is reopened, a keep bet will not

            <h3>12. Rules for Tote betting</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>
                When you place a Tote bet on the platform (for example a UK or
                South African Tote bet), you are betting against as counterparty
                to your bet. I will then strike a corresponding bet into the
                relevant Tote pool as applicable.
              </li>

              <li>
                A link to the rules which apply to Tote bets struck as
                counterparty is provided within each of the relevant. If there
                is any conflict between those rules and either: the equivalent
                rules available on the relevant Tote website (for example on the
                UK Tote website in the case of UK Tote bets); or the equivalent
                rules applied by the relevant host racetrack, the rules on the
                relevant Tote website or applied by the relevant host racetrack,
                will prevail.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>13. Miscellaneous</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>
                All references to time periods in the Exchange Rules relate to
                the time zone in which the event takes place. For example, a
                reference to the start time of a football match, relates to the
                local kick-off time.
              </li>

              <li>
                All information is done so in good faith. However, it cannot
                accept liability for any errors or omissions in respect of any
                information, such as the posting of prices, runners, times,
                scores, results or general statistics.
              </li>

              <li>
                It reserves the right to correct any obvious errors and shall
                take all reasonable steps to ensure markets are administered
                with integrity and transparency.
              </li>

              <li>
                If an incorrect team or competitor name is displayed (excluding
                minor spelling mistakes) or the incorrect number of teams,
                competitors or outcomes is displayed in any complete market or a
                market is otherwise loaded using incorrect information (for
                example the application of an incorrect exposure algorithm or a
                cross matching tool utilising an incorrect algorithm) or
                includes any obvious error such as the incorrect deployment of
                the cross matching tool, then It reserves the right to suspend
                the market and (providing it acts reasonably) to void all bets
                matched on the market.
              </li>

              <li>
                Customers are responsible for ensuring that they satisfy
                themselves that the selection on which they place a bet is their
                intended selection. For example, in the case of a competitor
                bearing the same name as another individual not competing in the
                relevant event, the onus is on the customer to ensure that they
                know which competitor It has loaded into the relevant market and
                to ensure that they are placing their bet on their chosen
                competitor.
              </li>

              <li>
                It reserves the right at any time in its sole and absolute
                discretion to suspend an Exchange market.
              </li>

              <li>
                It may, in its sole and absolute discretion, decide to suspend
                betting on a market at any time (even if such suspension is
                earlier than anticipated by the Exchange Rules). In the
                interests of maintaining integrity and fairness in the markets,
                it may also void certain bets in a market or void a whole market
                in its entirety.
              </li>

              <li>
                It reserves the right to amend the Exchange Rules at any time.
              </li>

              <li>
                It reserves the right to cancel unmatched bets to protect
                customers at any time.
              </li>

              <li>
                On the settlement of any market, amounts relating to

                <ul>
                  <li>winnings/losses on bets; and</li>

                  <li>commission charges</li>
                </ul>

                will be rounded up or down to the nearest two decimal places
                (with the exception that rounding will always be down (and never
                up) in respect of amounts relating to winnings/losses in respect
                of BSP bets). By way of example, £3.333, will be settled as
                £3.33, whereas £3.335, will be settled as £3.34 (except that it
                will be settled as £3.33 in respect of an amount relating to
                winnings/losses in respect of BSP bets).
              </li>

              <li>
                The Exchange Rules have been prepared in various languages other
                than English for reference only. In the event of any differences
                between the English version and the non-English version, the
                English version shall prevail.

                one finisher in a race, an eight runner-greyhound races will be
                allocated 20 points and all other races will be allocated 12
                points.
              </li>

              <li>
                If a whole meeting is abandoned all bets are void however if at
                least one race has been completed then bets on these markets
                will stand with the remaining races allocated 20 points for
                eight runner greyhound races and 12 points for all other races.
              </li>

              <li>Re-run races will be treated as cancelled races.</li>

              <li>
                If there is a dead heat for the winner between two greyhounds
                then to calculate the applicable multi-trap number for that race
                the trap numbers for the greyhounds involved in the dead heat
                will be multiplied by each other to give the applicable
                multi-trap number.
              </li>

              <li>
                If there is a dead heat for the winner between three or more
                greyhounds then to calculate the applicable multi-trap number
                for that race the trap numbers for the greyhounds involved in
                the dead heat will be added up and divided by the number of
                greyhounds involved in the dead heat and the resulting number
                will be multiplied by itself to give the applicable multi-trap
                number (even if not a round number). By way of example: traps 1,
                3 and 6 dead heat for first. Add these numbers up gives 10;
                divide this number by the number of greyhounds in the dead heat
                (3) which gives a resulting number of 3.33; multiply 3.33 by
                itself to give 11.11.
              </li>

              <li>
                If there is a dead heat for the runner up between two or more
                greyhounds then to calculate the applicable multi-trap number
                for that race the trap numbers for the greyhounds involved in
                the dead heat will be added up and divided by the number of
                greyhounds involved in the dead heat and the resulting number
                will be multiplied by the number of the winner to give the
                applicable multi-trap number (even if not a round number). By
                way of example: trap 1 wins and traps 3 and 6 dead heat for
                second. Adding the numbers of the dead heating runners up gives
                9; divide this number by the number of greyhounds in the dead
                heat (2) which gives a resulting number of 4.5; multiple 4.5 by
                the winning number (1) to give 4.5.

            <h4>➢ Winning Distances</h4>

            <ul>
              <li>
                'Winning distances' bets are on the sum of the winning distances
                for all races during a race meeting, unless otherwise stated in
                the Market Information.
              </li>

              <li>The maximum winning distance in any race is 10 lengths.</li>

              <li>
                If there is only one finisher in any race the winning distance
                will be deemed to be 10 lengths.
              </li>

              <li>
                If a race is cancelled, void or abandoned the winning distance
                will be deemed to be 2 lengths.
              </li>

              <li>Re-run races will be treated as cancelled races.</li>

              <li>
                For distances below half a length, the following scale will be
                applied: Short-head 0.1; Head 0.2; Neck 0.3.
              </li>

              <li>
                The sum of all the winning distances will be rounded to the
                nearest whole number at the end of the meeting (rounded up, if
                half) and bets will be settled on this result.
              </li>

              <li>
                If a whole meeting is abandoned all bets are void. However, if
                at least one race has been completed then the remaining races
                are allocated 2 lengths each and bets will stand.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>➢ Match Bets</h4>

            <ul>
              <li>
                'Match Bets' for a race are determined by the greyhound with the
                highest finishing position in that race. If neither greyhound
                finishes the race bets are void. If only one of the greyhounds
                finishes the race, that greyhound will be deemed the winner. If
                a non-runner or reserve runner is declared then all bets will be
                void.
              </li>

              <li>
                'Match Bets' for progress in a competition are determined by the
                greyhound which qualifies to the furthest round (whether it runs
                in the further round or not). If the greyhounds concerned fail
                to qualify in the same round of the competition then the market
                will be settled as a dead heat, irrespective of their finishing
                positions in their individual heats.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>➢ Reverse Forecasts</h4>

            <ul>
              <li>
                'Reverse Forecast' markets are determined by those greyhounds
                placed first and second in a race.
              </li>

              <li>
                If a dead heat affects the reverse forecast then dead heat rules
                apply.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>➢ Place markets</h4>

            <ul>
              <li>
                The number of winners in 'to be placed' markets is as set out in
                the Market Information and is determined with reference to the
                number of runners when the market is loaded.
              </li>

              <li>
                Once opened, the number of winners in 'to be placed' markets (as
                set out in the Market Information) will not be affected by
                further non-runners. If the number of potential winners is equal
                to or is greater than the number of runners, all bets in this
                market will be void.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>➢ To Reach the Final and To Qualify markets</h4>

            <ul>
              <li>
                'Reach the Final' markets shall be determined by the first six
                greyhounds who qualify from the Semi Finals of the competition
                and be settled as such regardless of whether they go on to run
                in the final or not.
              </li>

              <li>
                'To qualify' markets shall be determined by the greyhounds that
                qualify in the relevant heats irrespective of whether they run
                in the next round or not.
              </li>

              <li>
                The 'reach the final' or 'to qualify' markets will be settled
                after the qualifying stages and any subsequent disqualification
                or amendment to results will not count.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>➢ Ante-post</h4>

            <ul>
              <li>
                If a greyhound listed in an ante-post market dies, it will use
                the available information to determine the time of the
                greyhound's death. It will then, acting reasonably, determine
                whether the greyhound was a 'material runner' in the market. In
                determining whether a greyhound is a material runner, it will
                look at the general price of the greyhound immediately before
                the greyhound's death, in the market and in the wider betting
                market. Broadly, it will consider a greyhound to be a material
                runner if it is deemed to have an approximate chance of winning
                of 8-10 per cent or better.
              </li>

              <li>
                If It determines that the greyhound was a 'material runner',
                then all bets struck in the market (on all selections) between
                the time of death and the suspension of the market will be void
                and all unmatched bets will be cancelled before the market is
                reopened.
              </li>

              <li>
                If It determines that the greyhound was not a 'material runner',
                then just bets struck on the greyhound in question between the
                time of death and the suspension of the market will be void and
                unmatched bets will not be cancelled before the market is
                reopened.
              </li>

              <li>
                Bets matched on greyhounds after they have forfeited their entry
                at a particular entry stage or where they have not qualified by
                the applicable qualifying date will be voided unless the race in
                question has a subsequent supplementary entry stage.
              </li>

              <li>
                Where an event is postponed or rescheduled to another day at the
                same venue then ante-post bets will stand unless entries are
                reopened in which case all bets will be void.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>➢ Australian Specific Non-Runner Rules</h4>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Notwithstanding any of the above, the following rules apply to
                declared non-runners in Australian greyhound markets.
              </li>

              <li>
                If a greyhound becomes a notified non-runner after the market is
                loaded but prior to the commencement of the race it will be
                removed and all bets on the market, matched prior to the update
                of the market will be voided.
              </li>

              <li>
                If, following the completion of a race, the stewards declare a
                greyhound a non-runner, it will resettle the market and will
                void all bets that were placed on that runner only. It will then
                apply a reduction factor to all bets placed on the winner (or
                place getters in the case of place markets) based on that
                runner’s weighted average price.

            <ul>
              <li>
                All individual race markets will be determined according to the
                official result at the time of the 'weigh-in' announcement (or
                equivalent). Subsequent disqualifications, appeals or amendments
                to the result will be disregarded.

              <li>
                If the scheduled venue is changed after the market has been

              <li>
                If a horse listed in an ante-post market dies, it will use the
                available information to determine the time of the horse's
                death. It will be acting reasonably, determine whether the horse
                was a 'material runner' in the market. It will undertake a
                similar determination in cases where it is advised through
                official channels that a runner has been formally scratched from
                an ante-post race. In determining whether a horse is a material
                runner, it will consider the general price of the horse
                immediately before the horse's death (or immediately before
                being advised it has been scratched), in the market and in the

            <h4>➢ EW markets</h4>

            <ul>
              <li>
                The place portion of any "Each Way" bet will be settled
                according to the number of 'places' and at the fraction of the
                win portion profit stated in the market information.
              </li>

              <li>
                For example: “EW Terms: 1/5th odds, 3 places”. That “1/5th” is
                applied to the traditional or fractional odds, which are 1 less
                than decimal odds, so the calculation of the Place odds
                corresponding to Win odds of 8.0 in this market is ((8.0 – 1) /
                5) + 1 = 2.4.
              </li>

              <li>
                Once opened, the number of places in 'EW” markets will not be
                affected by further non-runners unless the number of ‘places’
                which are offered on the ‘Each Way’ market is equal to or
                exceeds the number of runners in which case, the place portion
                of any EW bet will be voided at settlement.

            <h4>➢ Winning Distance Bets</h4>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Unless stated otherwise in the Market Information, winning
                distances' bets are on the sum of the winning distances from
                each race on one particular day at a race meeting.
              </li>

              <li>
                The winning distance in a race will be the officially declared
                distance between the first two horses past the post. However, if
                either the first or second horse past the post is disqualified
                because: (i) of an incorrect weight carried; (ii) they have
                taken the wrong course; (iii) the jockey of either horse fails
                to weigh in, or weighs in light after the race; then in each
                case the winning distance shall be that between the first and
                second horse under the official result.
              </li>

              <li>
                For the purpose of this bet, the maximum distance on any
                individual race will be 12 lengths for Flat races and 30 lengths
                for National Hunt races (which includes National Hunt Flat
                Races) and these distances will be applied where only one horse
                finishes a race. For distances below half a length, the
                following scale will be applied:

                <ul>
                  <li>Nose: 0.05 length</li>

                  <li>Short-head: 0.1</li>

                  <li>Head: 0.2</li>

                  <li>Short-neck: 0.25</li>

                  <li>Neck: 0.3</li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>
                If a meeting has three or more races abandoned or declared void,
                then all 'winning distance' bets will be void, unless the entire
                market has been unconditionally determined.
              </li>

              <li>
                When only one or two races are abandoned or declared void, then
                'winning distance' bets will be settled with a default distance
                used for each abandoned or void race. The default distances are
                2 lengths for Flat races and 10 lengths for National Hunt races.
              </li>

              <li>
                In the case of a walkover the following distances will be
                applied:

                <ul>
                  <li>Flat: 5 lengths</li>

                  <li>National Hunt: 12 lengths</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>➢ Non-Runner Rule</h4>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Non-runner rule relates to the adjustment of odds on bets
                already matched when a horse in a race is declared a non-runner.
                In order to make the adjustment applies a reduction factor to
                the remaining runners. The reduction factor allocated to a
                non-runner is a calculation (the details of which are described
                below) of that horse's chances of winning (or being placed, etc.
                as appropriate) and is applied to bets already matched on the
                other runners in the relevant market or markets.
              </li>

              <li>
                Any horse listed when the relevant market is loaded which does
                not subsequently come under starter's orders is deemed to be a
                non-runner.
              </li>

              <li>
                When the market is loaded each horse is given a 'reduction
                factor', based on a forecast price, which is expressed as a
                percentage. These reduction factors may be updated periodically
                at the discretion based on trading in the market, but after
                approximately 15 minutes (approximately 5 minutes for Australian
                and US markets) from the scheduled 'off' time of a given race,
                they will be updated only in exceptional circumstances.
              </li>

              <li>
                Reductions will be made to both win and place markets but
                applied differently (as described below), and horses will have a
                different reduction factor for each market.
              </li>

              <li>
                As soon as becomes aware that a horse is an official non-runner
                or a highly likely non-runner, following a statement to the
                press from connections, the following will happen:
              </li>

              <li>
                All matched bets on that horse will be void and the horse will
                be removed from the market.
              </li>

              <li>
                In the win market: if the reduction factor of the non-runner is
                2.5% or greater, the traded price of all the matched bets on the
                remaining horses will be reduced by an amount equal to the
                non-runner's final reduction factor and all the unmatched offers
                to lay will be cancelled. If the non-runner's reduction factor
                is less than 2.5%, reductions will not be applied and unmatched
                bets will not be cancelled.
              </li>

              <li>
                In the place market, the reduction factor of all non-runners
                will be applied (even if less than 2.5%) and the potential
                winnings in relation to matched bets on the remaining horses
                will be reduced by an amount equal to the non-runner's final
                reduction factor. Only if the non-runner's reduction factor is
                4.0% or greater will all the unmatched offers to lay be
                cancelled.
              </li>

              <li>
                All the reduction factors on the remaining horses will be
                adjusted to reflect their improved chance of winning.
              </li>

              <li>
                Reduction factors are not applied to bets which are struck
                in-play. However, if a market is turned in-play prematurely by
                error (or, for example, there is a false start), all bets
                matched during this time will be subject to any later reduction
                factor, provided the market is turned out of play before the
                race commences. In the event of a late withdrawal, it reserves
                the right to remove the runner after completion of the race. In
                this case only those bets matched prior to the off will be
                affected by a reduction factor.
              </li>

              <li>
                In the event of a non-runner being removed from a race in error
                or following incorrect information regarding a runner’s
                participation, it will reinstate both the runner and all
                previously matched bets associated with that runner. All bets
                made between the time of withdrawal and reinstatement will be
                void in both the place market and the win market. The reduction
                factor applied to matched bets at the time of withdrawal will be
                reversed and the original prices will become valid.
              </li>

              <li>
                Any non-runners will be removed from the relevant markets in the
                order in which they are brought to attention. If It becomes
                aware of more than one non-runner at the same time, it will
                remove the non-runners from the relevant markets in race card
                order.
              </li>

              <li>
                If a runner is not included in a market because of an error or
                because of incorrect information regarding a runner’s
                participation, It reserve the right to introduce the missing
                runner into the market at any time prior to settlement (even
                after the race has been run), provided that It has determined
                that the missing runner is not a material runner (i.e. a
                selection with a reduction factor of approx. 2.5% or less in the
                win market). In such circumstances, all pre-play unmatched and
                matched bets will stand, however if the runner is not introduced
                before the start of the race, all in-play bets will be void.
                However, if the missing runner is deemed to be a material
                runner, then the malformed market will be void and a new market
                will be loaded where possible.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>➢ How the Reductions are applied for Exchange markets</h4>

            <ul>
              <li>
                In the win market, reductions will be made on the traded price.
              </li>

              <li>
                For example: if the non-runner's final reduction factor is 25%
                the traded price on all previously matched bets on other horses
                will be reduced by 25% - traded price of 8.0 would become 6.0
                etc. And these might be further reduced if another horse is
                subsequently declared a non-runner.
              </li>

              <li>
                In the EW Market, reductions will be made on the traded win
                price. The advertised place terms will then apply to the revised
                win prices.
              </li>

              <li>
                For example: if the non-runner's final reduction factor is 25%
                the traded price on all previously matched bets on other horses
                will be reduced by 25% - - traded price of 8.0 would become 6.0.
                If each Way terms were 1/5th odds for 3 places, the
                corresponding price for the Place portion of the bet would
                reduce from 2.4 to 2.0.
              </li>

              <li>
                In the place market, reductions will be made to the potential
                winnings on the bet only, and not the traded price.
              </li>

              <li>
                For example: if the non-runner's final reduction factor is 25%
                the potential winnings on all previously matched bets on the
                other horses will be reduced by 25% - a traded price of 8.0
                would become 6.25. For example, a £10 bet on a horse to be
                placed at a traded price of 8.0 would provide winnings of £70.
                If there is a non-runner with a reduction factor of 25% in the
                race, that factor will be applied to the £70 of potential
                winnings leaving potential winnings of £52.50. Therefore, the
                revised traded price will be 6.25.
              </li>

              <li>
                The traded price may be further reduced if any other horse(s) is
                subsequently declared a non-runner, however odds cannot be
                reduced below 1.01.
              </li>

              <li>
                Reserves: A reserve runner may appear in the relevant markets
                but will have a non-applicable reduction factor until It has
                received confirmation that it is a confirmed runner, in which
                case an applicable reduction factor may apply to it.
              </li>

              <li>
                For the avoidance of doubt, any reduction factor applicable to a
                non-runner replaced by a reserve, will be applied to all bets
                struck on the relevant markets, prior to the removal from those
                markets of such non-runner. Likewise, should a reserve runner
                become a confirmed runner but subsequently become a non-runner,
                any reduction factor applicable to such non-runner will be
                applied to all bets struck on the relevant markets, prior to the
                removal from those markets of such non-runner.

            <ul>
              <li>
                'Tournament points' and 'tournament tries' bets will apply to
                all playing time, including any extra-time in any match where an
                official result is declared.
              </li>

              <li>
                For 'time of first try' bets, if the try is scored in the second
                half, the first half is deemed to have lasted 40 minutes,
                regardless of stoppage-time. If no try is scored, or the try is
                scored in second half stoppage-time or extra-time, the result is
                80.
              </li>

              <li>
                For the purpose of markets involving tries, penalty tries will
                count with the exception of 'first individual try scorer'
                markets where penalty tries will not count.
              </li>

              <li>
                If a match starts but is abandoned before its completion, all
                bets will be void unless an official result is declared by the
                applicable governing body. Where an official result has been
                declared by the official governing body, that official result
                will govern match and handicap market settlement but all other
                markets will be void unless their result has already been
                determined at the point of abandonment (i.e. at the point of
                abandonment, it would not have been possible for the outcome of
                the bet to change had the match continued to its natural
                conclusion). By way of example, if 37 points have been scored at
                the time a match is abandoned: (i) a bet placed on 35 points or
                more to be scored would be settled as a winning bet, (ii) a bet
                placed on 30-35 points to be scored would be settled as a losing
                bet and (iii) a bet placed on 40-45 points to be scored would be
                void. In such circumstances, bets on last try scorer / team to
                score last / team to score last try / last scoring play would
                all be void.

                In the event of a match starting but not being completed, the
                player progressing to the next round will be deemed the winner
                (or in the case of the final the player declared the winner).
              </li>

              <li>
                If a match is not completed for any reason then bets on 'any
                correct score' or 'next frame' market will be void.
              </li>

              <li>
                If a match is not completed for any reason, bets on any handicap
                market will be void unless the market has been unconditionally
                determined.
              </li>

            <h3>19. Soccer</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>
                If it does not suspend a market on time for the occurrence of a
                Material Event, it reserves the right to void bets unfairly
                matched after the Material Event has occurred. Voiding of these
                bets may take place during the event or retrospectively once a
                game is completed.
              </li>

              <li>
                If a match has not started (or believes that a match will not
                have started) by 23:59 (local time) on its scheduled start date,
                then all bets will be void unless it has knowledge that the
                match has been rescheduled to be played within three days of its
                original start date.
              </li>

              <li>
                If a match starts but is later abandoned or postponed and
                believes that the match will not have been completed by 23:59
                (local time) on its scheduled start date, then all markets, with
                the exception of any unconditionally determined markets, will be
                void unless it has knowledge that the match has been rescheduled
                to be played within three days of its original start date. If it
                does have knowledge that the game will be played within three
                days and the game is played within three days, then all bets
                will stand except if the match is restarted from the beginning.
                If the match is restarted from the beginning then all bets
                matched before the market went in-play will stand, but any bets
                placed in-play will be void, except for any bets placed in-play
                on markets which have been unconditionally determined, which
                will stand.
              </li>

              <li>
                For Friendly matches, all bets apply to the full duration of
                play according to the match officials, plus any stoppage time.
                If a friendly match starts but is later abandoned or postponed
                and is not completed (i.e. the full duration of play according
                to match officials, plus any stoppage time) within three days of
                the scheduled start date, all bets will be void except for those
                on markets which have been unconditionally determined. In the
                case of ambiguity over the official result from match officials,
                the outcome will be determined (acting reasonably) using
                information from independent sources.
              </li>

              <li>
                If an official fixture lists different team details to those
                listed (for example, the team name, reserves, age group, gender,
                etc.), then all bets matched on the affected markets will be
                void. In all other cases, bets will stand (including instances
                where a team name is listed without specifying the term 'XI' in
                the name). If an official fixture is shown on the website under
                an incorrect competition name, then it reserves the right to
                void all bets matched on the affected markets.
              </li>

              <li>
                If a team is relegated from a league because, at the end of a
                season, it has finished within the relegation positions which
                are relevant to that league (i.e. usually any of the bottom
                three league positions), bets on that team to be relegated will
                be settled as winning bets. If a team is otherwise disqualified,
                thrown out or removed from a league (i.e. in circumstances other
                than those where it has finished the season within the relevant
                relegation positions): (i) if such team is disqualified, thrown
                out or removed from the league before the relevant season has
                started, all bets on the affected market will be void (and a new
                market will subsequently be loaded) and (ii) if such team is
                disqualified, thrown out or removed from the league after the
                relevant season has started (or a determination is made by the
                applicable governing body, during the season, that the team will
                be thrown out or removed from the league following the season’s
                conclusion), all bets on the affected team will be void. For the
                avoidance of doubt, if a points deduction is imposed on a team
                such that it finishes the season within the relegation places
                which are relevant to the applicable league, bets on that team
                to be relegated will be settled as winning bets.
              </li>

              <li>
                The relevant season will be deemed to have started once the
                first league game has been played. For the purposes of this
                rule, markets relating to individual matches will not be deemed
                to be "affected markets".
              </li>

              <li>
                'Shirt numbers' bets will refer to the shirt number allocated at
                the start of the match. 'Shirt numbers' bets will include
                own-goal scorers. Any player whose shirt bears no number will be
                allocated the number 12.
              </li>

              <li>
                For 'time of first goal' bets (i.e. "First Goal Odds" markets),
                the first half is deemed to last 45 minutes, regardless of
                stoppage time. Also for these markets, please note that the "0 -
                10 Minutes" selection covers the first 10 minutes of the match.
                In other words, it runs from 0:00 until just before the clock
                hits 10:00. The "11 – 20 Minutes" selection runs from 10:00
                until just before the clock hits 20:00. The same principle
                applies to each of the other selections in this market.
              </li>

              <li>
                For 'top goal scorer' markets only the goals scored in the
                league or competition stated in the Market Information count.
                For example, if a player joins a club mid-season any goals
                scored in a different league will not count, however goals
                scored for a different club in the same league will count. Own
                goals will not count.
              </li>

              <li>
                In markets which relate to the number of incidents to occur,
                such as 'number of corners', these will be determined on the
                basis of the number taken, rather than awarded.
              </li>

              <li>
                For markets that relate to the number of bookings given, the
                number of corners taken, any goal scorer or the time of a
                particular goal, the result will be determined (acting
                reasonably) using information from independent sources. In such
                cases, if any new information comes into the public domain
                within 48 hours of settlement, then it shall (acting reasonably)
                determine either: (i) whether the market should be reinstated or
                resettled in light of this new information; or (ii) to wait for
                further information before deciding whether to reinstate or
                resettle the market. Except it has announced that it is waiting
                for further information, any information that comes into the
                public domain more than 48 hours after a market has been settled
                shall not be considered (regardless of whether or not such
                information may have led to a different result).

                amendment is announced within 24 hours of the initial settlement

                the player or pairing progressing to the next round (or winning
                the tournament in the case of a final) will be deemed the
                winner. However, if less than one set has been completed at the
                time of the retirement or disqualification then all bets
                relating to that individual match will be void.

                All bets relating to the number of occurrences of certain events

                which have been unconditionally determined.
              </li>

              <li>
                All bets will stand regardless of changes to scheduled venues,

              </li>

              <li>
                If the scheduled duration of a match is reduced or increased in
                the number of games/sets required to win, all bets will be void
                except for those on markets which have been unconditionally
                determined. Please note that this does not apply to ‘Match Odds’
                or ‘Set Winner’ markets on Davis Cup matches or ‘dead rubber’
                matches that have been shortened from five sets to three sets
                after the market has been loaded, provided that the match has
                been shortened in accordance with the competition’s rules.

                Where markets are offered on individual games or sets within a

              browser cookies. They allow us to remember things about your
              visits across our sites.
            </p>

            <p>
              Neither cookies nor flash cookies can be used to access or use
              other information on your computer. We only use these methods to
              track your use of our services. Cookies help us monitor traffic to

              cookies to help us show you more relevant and desirable
              advertisements.
            </p>

            <h4>Strictly necessary cookies</h4>

            <p>
              Strictly necessary cookies are essential to allow a user move
              around a website and use its features, such as accessing secure
              areas of the website or making financial transactions. Without
              these cookies, we would not be able to make our websites work
              efficiently.
            </p>

            <h4>During the registration process</h4>

            <p>
              These cookies will hold information collected during your
              registration and will allow us to recognize you as a customer and
              provide you with the services you require. We may also use this

            <p>
              For visitors to our website, we use cookies to collect
              information. Our servers use three different types of cookies:
            </p>

            <p>
              A ‘session-based’ cookie: This type of cookie is only allocated to
              your computer for the duration of your visit to our website. A
              session-based cookie helps you move around our website faster and,
              if you’re a registered customer, it allows us to give you
              information that is more relevant to you. This cookie
              automatically expires when you close your browser.
            </p>

            <p>
              A ‘persistent’ cookie: This type of cookie will remain on your
              computer for a period of time set for each cookie. Flash cookies
              are also persistent.
            </p>

            <p>
              ‘Analytical’ cookies: This type of cookie allows us to recognize
              and count the number of visitors to our site and see how visitors
              use our services. These helps us improve the way our sites work,
              for example, by ensuring you can find what you are looking for
              easily.
            </p>

            <p>
              You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web
              browsers automatically accept cookies, but, if you prefer, you can
              usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. The Help
              menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent
              your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser
              notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable
              cookies altogether.
            </p>

            <h4>Flash cookies</h4>

            <p>
              You can modify your Flash Player settings to prevent the use of
              flash cookies. The Settings Manager of your Flash Player allows
              you manage your preferences. To disallow flash cookies from all
              third party content go to the ‘Global Storage Settings’ panel of
              the Settings Manager and de-select the check box labelled ‘Allow
              third party flash content to store information on your computer’

              your settings for specific websites you visit through the ‘Website
              Storage Settings’ panel which is also found in the Settings
              Manager.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you are using an old version of Flash Player or older web
              browser, the Settings Manager may not be available to you. We
              recommend that you ensure that you refresh your Flash Player and
              browser to the latest available versions.

              to or has submitted personal information via our services, we will
